# AngularCLI-Starter-Pack
Angular 2 CLI with Bootstrap 4 starter project. 


This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.16.

Clone this repo, then type 'npm install.' Be sure you have all the Dependencies of the CLI before attempting. This is a bare-bones project. If successfully installed, which isn't always a guarantee right now with Beta and Alpha software, you will see a few blank pages. I'm using the basic Angular router for navigation, which should be working. 

The project uses Gulp for sass compilation, which is just a preference. It's not needed, and you can rely on the CLI to handle the preprocessing. I just like the workflow a little better. On that note, I changed the name from the out of the box "styles.css" to "main.css" - if you don't want to use gulp, just use the base styles.css that the CLI creates in the root of src.

## Dependencies
Both the CLI and generated project have dependencies that require Node 4 or higher, together with NPM 3 or higher.
To install Bootstrap: 4 'npm install bootstrap'



## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.



## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
